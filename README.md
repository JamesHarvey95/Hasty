Hasty is a web-based start-up founded by two veterans whose mission is to make moving as simple as possible for service members and their families. Hasty is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code, I can only provide snippets of my code. This repository contains .NET, React, and SQL code for the Blogs feature.
My responsibility as a Full Stack Software Engineer was to create both the front end and back end of the blogs section of the website from the ground up. Below is a comprehensive list of the actions I took and the methods I implemented to achieve this.

-Used Formik to update state and create a preview of the published blog to the right of the form that automatically updates whenever the user types in a form field.

-Implemented SweetAlerts2 and Toastr to notify the user of un/successful actions such as publishing a new blog post or searching and filtering through blog posts.

-Used bootstrap classes to ensure the pages had the proper aesthetic uniformity and formatting.

-Implemented a finder function that took in the id of the selected value from the dropdown menu and returned the associated string value in a preview window next to the form.

-Implemented pagination component for a better organized UI.

-Built functionality to allow admins to see edit/delete buttons and a badge saying if a blog is public.

-Built functionality that lets any user see the full blog post when the card is clicked.

-Collaborated in a team that conducted daily stand-ups, code review, and code talks, while also using Git and GitHub as the source control and repo management system.

-Created a SQL database using multiple tables with foreign key relationships, built stored procedures to receive information and create new records.

-Built RESTful APIs by developing controllers and interfaces in the middle tier using C# and .NET ADO, to access SQL stored procedures, while testing API with Postman.

-Utilized git commands to create branches and once the work met a certain standard, merge the branch with the main set of code.

-Connected to Formik API for React form execution, and Yup API for client-side validation, managing user inputted content.

-Implemented content management for blogs.

-Utilized a third-party editor for the content section of the new blog form to allow the users to have a more dynamic design.

-Employed Axios/Ajax calls to retrieve data from the database.

-Utilized mapping to get raw information from Axios/Ajax calls and format it in the way that we want it to appear to the users.
